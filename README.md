# sophmoreIkigai

Welcome to my Sophmore Ikigai Project!
The goal of this project is to empower patients with their own data.

How often do you leave the docter's office, and soon forget your diagnosis, treatment plan, or medication schedule?
There's not much doctor-to-patient interfacing in current medical systems. This project aims to change that, drawing from a patient's own information in medical databases and presenting it to them in an easily understandable, easily accessable way.

This project was created for Robotics (Period 2) and Principles of Biomedical Science (Period 5) Honors Credit.
